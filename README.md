# Functions and Errors

This project is to demonstrate the use of assert(), revert() and require() statements

## Description

The assert() takes only one parameter as input, that is, the condition. If the conditions is true the execution continues.
The revert() can be used as flagging mechanism, it reverts all the changes back to initial state thus saving further gas loss.
The require() statement has two parameters, one the the condition, second is the message that is to be dysplayed if the condition fails (second condition is optional)
